    Warming up is very important.
    After that, I start working out.
    There are many different kinds of machines such as treadmill and stationary bicycles.
    My favorite machine is treadmill.
    I like jogging because it is good for my health.
    Last thing I do is taking a shower.
    I usually take 15 minutes for taking a shower.

    I like it very much because it relieves my stress.
    This is all I can say about my exercise at the gym.`,
